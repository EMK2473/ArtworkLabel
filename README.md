## Description
A Java program that models an artwork and its associated artist. The program stores and displays information about an artist, including their name, birth year, and death year (if applicable), as well as the title and creation year of the artwork. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation and class interactions.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/ArtworkLabel.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd ArtworkLabel 
```
- Compile the ArtworkLabel.java file: 
```Java
- javac ArtworkLabel.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java ArtworkLabel
```

## Application Usage
Once the program is running, it will prompt the user to input the artist's name, birth year, death year (if applicable), the artwork's title, and the year it was created. The program will then display the artist and artwork information.  Example:

Input:
```Java
Vincent van Gogh 
1853 
1890 
Starry Night 
1889 
```
Output:

```Java
Artist: Vincent van Gogh (1853 to 1890) 
Title: Starry Night, 1889 
```

If the artist's death year is unknown or not applicable, the output will indicate that the artist is still alive or information is unknown.
